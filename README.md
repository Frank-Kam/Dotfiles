# Dotfiles

This repository is dedicated to my Hyprland DWM Arch Linux configuration files.

# Installation Instructions

For users on Arch Linux, Iâ€™ve created a script to streamline the setup process. You can run the script to automatically configure your system. Alternatively, you can manually copy the configuration files to your system using the `cp` command.

To run the script:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Execute the script according to the provided instructions.

```shell
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Installation Script

The `./setup.sh` script helps with the fresh installation process and handles the git cloning of the repository. Alternatively, you can clone the repository manually and run `install.sh` directly.

## For manual configuration:

Just Copy the necessary files you want to your configuration directory:
   
```sh
cp -rv path/to/source/file /path/to/destination/
```

## Mirror Select

You can set up your system quickly without needing to clone or download the script separately. Simply use bash and curl to fetch and execute `setup.sh`, and then follow the prompts to complete the process.
